Only the right answer flies you to the next question!


Hi folks!

Isn't it great that interactive Google Earth quizes can now be played in a webbrowser! 

I adapted my Google Earth quiz template for use in the new Google Earth for Chrome and Android.

Basic template, features:
- multiple choice questions
- true or false questions
- optional 'skip question'-cheat (by uncommenting the link)

Version 1.0.1. (170421, adapted for use in the new Google Earth (for Chrome and Android) implements KML 2.2. Google extension features <a href="#1;flyto"> en <a href="#1;balloon"> in the html description of placemarks and folders.

Noob friendly instructions (are included in comments in the file and) are work in progres. Will folow here shortly.

Hope this will get you started and of course you're welcome to check out the issues. Even better: let me know where I can find your next quiz!

Cheers,
Dieter
