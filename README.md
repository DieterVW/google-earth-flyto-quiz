Only the right answer flies you to the next question!


Hi folks!

Isn't it great that interactive Google Earth quizes can now be played in a webbrowser! 

I adapted my Google Earth quiz template for use in the new Google Earth for Chrome and Android. It implements KML 2.2. (Google extension of OGC KML) features flyto and balloon in the html description of placemarks and folders.

Basic template, features:
- multiple choice questions
- true or false questions
- optional 'skip question'-cheat (by uncommenting the link)
- Non technical instructions are included in the file.

Version 1.0.2. is in English and has more and better instructions.

Hope this will get you started and of course you're welcome to check out the issues. Even better: let me know where I can find your next quiz!

Cheers,
Dieter
